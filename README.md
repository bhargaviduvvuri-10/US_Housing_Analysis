## 🔍 Findings & Insights

### 1. 📈 Home Prices Have Grown Steadily, with Sharp Dips During Recessions
- The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index shows a consistent long-term upward trend from 2005 to 2024.
- Two major downturns are clearly visible:
  - **2008–2009** (Great Recession)
  - **2020** (COVID Recession)

### 2. 💸 Interest Rates Strongly Influence Home Price Growth
- Low interest rates from 2009 to 2021 fueled home price growth.
- Rate hikes post-2022 visibly slow down the housing market.

### 3. 💰 Affordability is Declining Over Time
- Affordability Index (Income / Home Price) has declined, especially since 2012.
- Home prices are rising faster than household income.

### 4. 📉 Inflation and Home Prices Move in the Same Direction — But Not Equally
- While CPI and home prices rise together, home prices often rise faster.
- The 2021–2022 inflation spike corresponds to strong home price growth.

### 5. 🧑‍💼 Unemployment Spikes Coincide with Housing Market Disruptions
- Spikes in unemployment during 2008 and 2020 align with slowdowns in housing.
- Recent rebounds suggest stronger housing resilience post-COVID.

### 6. 🏗️ New Housing Supply Remains Inconsistent
- Housing completions dropped post-2008 and recovered slowly.
- Supply shortages likely contributed to price surges in the 2010s–2020s.
